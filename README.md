# Data_Analysis_with_LITA
## Project: Basic Analysis

### Project Overview
---
This project was aimed towards empowering ladies with tech skills of which i was privileged to be one of the participant. It aimed to cover a wide range of tools and functions for efficient and accurate analysis, visualization and reporting. 

### Data sources 
---
The primary source of dataset used for analysis was those provided by facilitators of the program as part of the course and others were from open-source platforms such as kaggle [visit here](https://www.kaggle.com)

### Tools Used
---
- Microsoft Excel [Download Here](https://www.microsoft.com)
  1. For Data Cleaning
  2. For Analysis 
  3. For Visualization
- SQL - Structured Query Language for querying of data
- GitHub for Portfolio Building

### Data Cleaning and Preparations 
---
In the initial phase of the training, we perform the following action;

1. Understanding different tabs, functions, query, syntax etc.  
2. Data loading and Inspection
3. Handling missing variables
4. Data Cleaning and Formating
5. Data valuation 

### Exploratory Data Analysis
---
EDA involved the exploring and analyzing of datasets to summarize their main characteristics and answer questions about the data;

- Understanding the Patterns
- Trends
- And relationship through Statistical Methods and Visualisation.
  
### Data Analysis 
---
This is where we include some basic lines of functions,code, queries or even some of the DAX expressions used for data valuation during the analysis training. Functions like;
- SUMIF
- AVERAGE
- PIVOT TABLE
- FIND
- VLOOKUP
- RAND
- CELL REFERENCING 
- TRIM, PROPER  etc.
  
Queries such as; 
```SQL
select Brands, sum(profit) as TotalProfit 
from InternationalBreweries
where countries = 'Nigeria' and years = '2017'
Group by Brands
order by 2 desc
```
