# Subscription Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes customer data for a subscription service to understand subscription behavior, segment customers, and identify trends in cancellations and renewals.

## Data Source
The primary Source of dataset used for this analysis was those provided by facilitators of the program as part of the course.

## Data Collected
The dataset includes the following key columns:

1. Revenue: Total amount of income generated by the services.
2. Canceled: This shows the subscription status, whether cancellation was true or false. 
3. Customer name: The names of each customers
4. CustomerID: The identification tag specific to a particular Customer.
5. Subscription Start: The date on which a particular subscription was made.
6. Subscription End: The date on which a particlar subscription expired. 
7. Region: The geographical area where the company operates.
8. Subscription Type:  The different types of services recieved by the customers.

## Objectives
1. Identify key customer segments based on subscription type and region.
2. Track subscription trends, focusing on cancellations and renewals.
3. Analyze revenue contributions by subscription type.
   
## Tools Used
- **Excel**: Data cleaning, calculations.
- **SQL**: Data querying and extraction.
- **Power BI**: Dashboard creation for data visualization.

## Exploratory Data analysis, insight uncovered and Recommendations
- ## Excel Analysis
 ### Data Cleaning:
1. Handle Missing Values: Identifying and addressing any gaps in data.
2. Remove Duplicates: Ensuring no redundant data records are present.

 ### Data Analysis: 
- The data was converted into a table. Two new column (Subscription Duration and Cancellation Status) were created to aid a more precise and clear analyis, and average subscription duration was calculated using formular to allow for an auto update if there is any changes or additon to the dataset.

 **Formular Used**

  ```
 Cancellation Status =IF(G2=FALSE,"Active","Canceled")
  ```

  ```
 Subscription Duration =AVERAGE([@SubscriptionEnd]-[@SubscriptionStart])
  ```

  ```
 Average Subscription Duration =AVERAGE(Subscription Duration)
  ```
- Pivot table was then used to summarize the data for easier interpretation;
1. **Total Subscription by Type**:
- *key insight*: Basic tier with 16,921 subscriptions holds the majority of subscriptions, accounting for a significantly larger share than both the Premium and Standard tiers combined.
This suggests that the Basic subscription is likely the most accessible or appealing to a broader audience, potentially due to a lower price or essential features that meet the needs of many users.

  The Premium tier has 8,446 subscriptions, which is slightly higher than the Standard tier but only about half the number of Basic subscriptions. This tier might appeal to customers looking for more features or services beyond what the Basic subscription offers but are still a smaller, more specialized segment compared to Basic.

  With 8,420 subscriptions, the Standard tier is very close in popularity to the Premium tier, indicating a balance in customer demand for mid-range and high-tier options. The similarity in numbers between Standard and Premium may suggest that both tiers offer valuable enhancements over the Basic tier, catering to specific customer preferences for additional features.

- *Potential Strategic Actions*: Offer time-limited promotions, such as a free trial of Premium or Standard, to let Basic users experience higher-tier benefits without an upfront commitment. This could increase conversions after the trial period. Also Consider bundling add-on services with Standard or Premium subscriptions to make these plans more attractive. This can create a sense of added value and encourage users to upgrade.
  
  With the Standard and Premium plans close in numbers, consider enhancing the Standard plan to better distinguish it from Basic without overlapping too much with Premium. For example, add more appealing features or customer support options.

  Provide incentives for users to upgrade when they renew their subscriptions. For example, offer a discount on the first few months when upgrading from Basic to Standard or Premium.

  Regularly collect feedback from customers across all tiers to understand what aspects of each subscription plan they value most and what they feel is missing. Based on user feedback, adjust the feature offerings within each plan to ensure each one meets the needs of its target demographic. This can prevent feature overlap between tiers and better align each plan with customer expectations.

  Track how many Basic users upgrade to higher tiers over time, and refine marketing and feature offerings accordingly.

## Key Findings
- Subscription **Type A** contributed the highest revenue but also had a high cancellation rate.
- Regional differences show that **Region X** has the most engaged customers.

## Conclusion
With the significant difference between Basic and other tiers, there may be an opportunity to convert Basic users to Standard or Premium with targeted offers or additional incentives.
